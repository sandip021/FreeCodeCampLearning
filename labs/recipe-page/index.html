    <h1>Cheese Toastie</h1>
    <p>The cheese toastie is the ultimate comfort classic: a golden, butter-crisped sandwich that hides a center of molten, gooey cheese. Simple to make yet incredibly satisfying, it's a timeless favorite that turns a few basic pantry staples into a warm, soul-soothing meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Two slices of thick white bread</li>
      <li>Salted butter, softened</li>
      <li>Grated or sliced cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>A pinch of sea salt (optional, for the crust)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Spread softened butter generously onto one side of each bread slice.</li>
      <li>Place one slice butter-side down in a pan and top with plenty of cheese.</li>
      <li>Cover with the second slice (butter-side up) and fry over medium-low heat until golden.</li>
      <li>Flip the toastie and cook until both sides are crisp and the cheese is fully melted.</li>
    </ol>
